## 📘 Project Overview

This project applied **Topological Data Analysis (TDA)** to forecast **steel demand time series** for **Fortacero**, a leading company in the steel industry.  
The goal was to leverage topological structures within demand patterns to **enhance production strategy planning** and **reduce forecasting errors**.

**Duration:** February 2025 – June 2025  
**Institution:** Tecnológico de Monterrey  
**Type:** Academic–Industry Collaboration

## 🎯 Objectives

- Develop a **TDA-based clustering approach** to identify structural similarities among steel demand time series.  
- Integrate topological insights into **time-series forecasting models** for more robust demand prediction.  
- Optimize **production scheduling and inventory planning** using improved forecast accuracy.

## 🧠 Methodology (High-Level Overview)

1. **Data Preprocessing**  
   - Aggregation and normalization of multi-source steel demand data.  
   - Outlier detection and smoothing for temporal consistency.

2. **Topological Data Analysis (TDA)**  
   - Construction of **Mapper graphs** to visualize shape and structure in high-dimensional demand trajectories.  
   - Clustering based on topological features, identifying intrinsic demand regimes.

3. **Forecasting Models**  
   - Developed **scaled ARIMA** and **hybrid TDA–statistical models** per cluster.  
   - Benchmarked against traditional ARIMA and Prophet models.

4. **Evaluation**  
   - Achieved **92% clustering accuracy**.  
   - Obtained a **Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE)** of **8.88%**, outperforming baseline models by up to **4%**.  
   - Enabled forecasting with **reduced computational overhead**, suitable for industrial-scale deployment.
